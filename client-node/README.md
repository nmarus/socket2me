```bash
$ npm install socket2me-client --save
```

### Properties

#### socket2me#callbackUrl
This is the generated URL for using with callbacks. It will look something like 
`http://servername/v1/go/jdfdjhfjdkhfajddjfadh`

### Functions

#### socket2me.processReq(function(req) {});
Defines function to process rests for this client received from the server. The 
request object contains the following three objects:

* `req.headers` : An object including the headers received at server
* `req.params` : An ibject wi the parsed parsed paramenters from url query 
  strings, body json, and any form URL encoded or multipart encoded body values.
* `req.body` : raw contents of the request body. used for manual parsing or 
  grabbing of binary data

### Events

#### 'connected'
This is triggered when the socket2me client has connected to a socker2me server.

#### 'disconnected'
This is triggered when the socket2me client has disconnected from a socker2me 
server.

#### 'error', function(err){}
This is triggered when the socket2me client has connected to a socker2me server.

##### Example:
```js
var Socket2meClient = require('socket2me-client')

// Socket host
var host = 'mysocketserver.com';

// Create new socket2me client and connect
var socket2me = new Socket2meClient(host);

// Connected event (fires shortly after Socket2meClient is instantiated)
socket2me.on('connected', function() {

  // The connected event will trigger when a connection is made AND will 
  // retrigger if the connection bounces.

  // Token will remain the same as long as the expire interval does not lapse 
  // during the disconnection.
 
  // Log value of socket2me.callbackUrl to console
  console.log('socket server url: %s', socket2me.callbackUrl);
  // Outputs [http://servername/v1/go/generatedtoken] At this point, run your 
  // functions that (re)create your webhooks with your API.
  
});

// disconnected event
socket2me.on('disconnected', function() {
  console.log('socket server disconnected');
});

// Define function that is triggered when request is made to the generated url
socket2me.listen(processReq);

function processReq(req) {
  // log request to console
  console.log('request: %s', JSON.stringify(req));

  // log a variable that might have been passed
  console.log(req.params.data.personEmail);

  // Run your functions that process the incoming request. 

  // No need to process a response as the spark2me-server reposnds 200/OK for 
  // all inbound requests if the client is connected.
}

```

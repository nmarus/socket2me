# API Reference for Socket2me Server
Server side of socket2me. It is recommened to use one of the socket2me-clients to connect to the server as it handles a lot of the API calls and token refresh operations automatically. 

## API calls
The following API calls are available on the server:

##### get http://server/v1/new

## Socket.io
Each token binds to a socket.io namespace. Only one client can be connected to a namespace/token at any time. If a second attempt to connect is made, the first connection is disconnected.

* socket server/namespace : http://server/`token`

###### Socket Events
* socket.on('request', function(req));

#### Request Object

The request body (if json), url query strings, and form URL encoded body values are parsed into `req.params`.

The request object includes:
* req.headers
* req.params
* req.body
